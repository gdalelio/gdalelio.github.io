#Welcome to Geoff d'Alelio's Github Page

I am new to github and am finding this tool/site to be very powerful as a collaboration site.  Our virtual team for SOABridge.org 
is learning the ins and outs and are amazed at the power which is easily harnessed here.  We are buiding a new middlewaare product,
and will be offering it as an open source tool. More to follow on that - find us at SOABridge.org.
